now lets talk about our fifth coin which is: <br>

<H1>LYDIAN ELECTRUM STATER</H1> <br> 
-it was one the world's first coins, struck in native electrum(alloy of gold-silver). <br> 
-it typically showed a lion or lion-bull design associated with royal authority. <br> 
-it pioneered denominations like trite and hekte for practicality. <br> 
-however variablility in elctrum composition complicated percise valuation <br> 
-it set the pattern for stamped, state-guarenteed money. <br>
