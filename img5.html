now lets talk about our fifth coin which is:

<H1>LYDIAN ELECTRUM STATER</H1>
-it was one the world's first coins, struck in native electrum(alloy of gold-silver).
-it typically showed a lion or lion-bull design associated with royal authority.
-it pioneered denominations like trite and hekte for practicality.
-however variablility in elctrum composition complicated percise valuation
-it set the pattern for stamped, state-guarenteed money.
