The second coin we are talking about is: 
(dumrollss!!)

<H1> ROMAN DENARIUS (Rome, 3rd BC- 3RD CE) </H1>
- The backbone silver coin of the roman republic and early empire.
-the most early versions of the coin show the images of deities but 
on the later version, it features emperors and propaganda scenes.
-Widespread circulation and use enabled soldier pay, taxation, and imperial logistics.
-Over time, silver content was debased, relecting economic strains on empires.
- its legacy however continue to survive in later monetray terms and symbols.
